MEAN Stack is a combination of following components:

1. MongoDB (Document database) – Stores and allows to retrieve data.

2. Express (Back-end application framework) – Makes requests to Database for Reads and Writes.

3. Angular (Front-end application framework) – Handles Client and Server Requests

4. Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment) – Accepts requests and displays results to end user

#### The project was completed with ease and launched on the server. No hassel or trounble encountered.
