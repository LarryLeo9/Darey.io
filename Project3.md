#MERN Stack Implementation

##Simple To-do application on MERN web stack

This project is the toughest i have ever experienced. I discovered that the EC2 must not be running live on ubuntu if you have not finished creating your POST and GET on postman. Also the database name on Mongodb account needs to be created and added after the forward slash sign (/) that follows the network name on the connecting string.
